# **Final Project Part I**
This project will explore enacted legislation in the United States regarding the implementation, testing, and/or exploration of autonomous vehicles, and any implications this legislation has on the future state of autonomous vehicles. Although many states have enacted legislation, even at a fully-autonomous level, all laws are with the undertanding that the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Congress overrule the state's laws if they were to made. Additionally, the fully autonomous, or level five, it is not yet realized from a technology perspective. The intention of the research is to understand which states is "ready" for fully autonomous and what states are more restrictive.


## **Project Outline** 
The intended audience for the project and visualizations are other state legislators so that they can develop an understanding of what currently exists and what may need to occur for cohesiveness across state lines if no federal regulation is established (outside of current recommendations and best practices as created by the [National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)](https://www.transportation.gov/av/3)).


## **Initial Sketches** 
The first sketch is an outline of how to tell the story, and what key data attributes will best tell that story.

This sketch intends to show the difference among the states using a map. I am unsure how I want to measure this data; count of the number of pieces of legislation, or color code based on the type of legislation.

This sketch will show the number of lives predicted to be saved by autonomous vehicle implementation. This is an important component to the story in that it builds the narrative for the necessity of the technology.

## **Data** 
The data was sourced from the National Conferene of State Legislatures (NCSL). The raw data and information can be found on their [website](https://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx).

The data regarding which states passed legislation, the year it was passed, and the text of the legislation, was gathered and put into Excel. Six policy categories and two other summary categories were created. The six policy categories are fully autonomous, testing, licensing/permit requirements, illegal to operate, platooing, and studies/commissions. The two other categories are the year the latest legislation was enacted and the number of laws passed by the state. View the raw [data](/Autonomous_Vehicle_Legislation.xlsx).

## **Method and Medium**
The final product will be presented in a [free WordPress website](https://tburandt94870.wordpress.com/‎(opens in a new tab)). THhe reason for choosing WordPress over Shorthand is due to the customizability of WordPress. Shorthand is very limited in its creative customizations. The current website is complete draft mode and not content other than the title and subtitle information has been updated. The layout is currently a work in progress as well.

The layout will be in a story format, similar to the first initial sketch above. The website will lay out a brief history of autonomous vehicles, the different levels of automation, the federal government's role, and the states' role in the technology. Throughout will be visualizations of what, how many, and when legislation was enacted and how all of that comes (or does not come) together. The purpose is to show the very different places the country is at when transportation literally travels across state lines. 

The goal is to persuade state legislators to either pass more similar legislation to allow for ease of testing and implementation; and/or motivate the federal government to pass legislation in order to unify the existing environment.
