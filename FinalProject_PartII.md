# **Final Project Part II**
This project will explore enacted legislation in the United States regarding the implementation, testing, and/or exploration of autonomous vehicles, and any implications this legislation has on the future state of autonomous vehicles. Although many states have enacted legislation, even at a fully-autonomous level, all laws are with the understanding that the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Congress overrule the state's laws if they were to be made. Additionally, a fully autonomous, or level five, vehicle is not yet realized from a technology perspective. The intention of the research is to understand which states are "ready" for fully autonomous and what states are more restrictive.


## **Project Storyboard** 
The first sketch is an outline of how to tell the story, and what key data attributes will best tell that story.

The following is the sketched storyboard of how the story is intended to be told in addition to the above sketch:

## **Project Wireframes** 
The initial data visualizations were created using two mediums, Tableau and Excel. These initial visualizations are based off of Part I sketches and details that can be found [here](/FinalProject_PartI.md). They are as follows:

## **User Research Protocol and Interview Responses** 
Questions were used to gather thoughts about the visualizations and story. The questions were adapted from those provided in class. The questions are as follows:
1. Can you tell me what you think these visualizations are about?
2. Can you describe to me what information these visualizations are telling you?
3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Three interviewees were selected. Interview 1 was a full time student with no familiarity of the topic; interview 2 was not a student and a person with a lot of familiarityof the topic; and Interview 3 was a student with some familiarity of the topic. The key points of their responses are as follows:

*Interview 1*
1. These visualizations are about the current status of autonomous vehicles and their legislation and the future impact that expanding legislation could have. 
2. Starts with information on human error and why we might want autonomous vehicles. Moves into areas where legislation exists that is ready for implementation and legislation that allows testing. 
3. It's confusing what the legislation enacted by year pie chart is supposed to be once the information is in there and how that is the best representation of the data. Also in the orange dot visualization about fatalities in 2017; those dots don't add up. 
4. State and local government audiences that might be considering implementing an autonomous vehicle policy/legislation.
5. Creating a different section before the history of AV policy that gives the stats on human error accidents and fatalities would be helpful. That gives a good lead in to why we might want to make this switch. 

*Interview 2*
1. A web page highlighting fatalities in the US by vehicles, and specifically if they were caused by human error.
2. The different ways fatalities occur, the levels of autonomy of a self driving car, and a video about why self driving cars aren't a thing yet.
3. The intent of the page isn't very clear without additional information. The message of each graphic was informative but I wasn't sure how they all tied together.
4. Policy makers, the media, and self-driving car companies.
5. Make sure each section of the web page represents the point you're trying to get across. I wasn't sure I saw a key point throughout.

*Interview 3*
1. This is about AVs versus regular cars, and related AV legislation.
2. Regular cars are bad and will kill you.
3. The dot visualization doesn't make any sense - fatalities from what? The map has no legend/key, and the pie chart has no labels so I'm not sure what they are trying to convey.
4. Legislators in states without AV legislation yet.
5. Clearer/more actionable "next steps" supported by data.

## **Revised Wireframes**
The following are the revisions on the existing visualizations based on interviewee feedback above:
![Visualization 1](/Deaths1.png)

![Visualization 2](/Map1.jpg)

![Visualization 3](/Map2.jpg)

![Visualization 4](/Map3.jpg)

More revisions include brainstorming how to visualize the next steps and what continuos autonomous vehicle legislation among states would look like via data. Additionally, most of the interviewees did not like the pie chart. Adding labels made the visualization appear too "busy" and adding a legend did not look good either. This is a visualization that needs to be reevaluated if it is necessary at all and if the information can be relayed in one simple sentence. The visualization does not seem to add to the story.
