# **Final Project Part II**
This project will explore enacted legislation in the United States regarding the implementation, testing, and/or exploration of autonomous vehicles, and any implications this legislation has on the future state of autonomous vehicles. Although many states have enacted legislation, even at a fully-autonomous level, all laws are with the understanding that the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Congress overrule the state's laws if they were to be made. Additionally, a fully autonomous, or level five, vehicle is not yet realized from a technology perspective. The intention of the research is to understand which states are "ready" for fully autonomous and what states are more restrictive.


## **Project Storyboard** 
The first sketch is an outline of how to tell the story, and what key data attributes will best tell that story.

The following is the sketched storyboard of how the story is intended to be told in addition to the above sketch:

## **Project Wireframes** 
The initial data visualizations were created using two mediums, Tableau and Excel. These initial visualizations are based off of Part I sketches and details that can be found [here](/FinalProject_PartI.md). They are as follows:

## **User Research Protocol and Interview Responses** 
Questions were used to gather thoughts about the visualizations and story. The questions were adapted from those provided in class. The questions are as follows:
1. Can you tell me what you think these visualizations are about?
2. Can you describe to me what information these visualizations are telling you?
3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Three interviewees were selected. Interview 1 was a full time student with no familiarity of the topic; interview 2 was not a student and a person with a lot of familiarityof the topic; and Interview 3 was a student with some familiarity of the topic. The key points of their responses are as follows:

*Interview 1*


*Interview 2*
1. A web page highlighting fatalities in the US by vehicles, and specifically if they were caused by human error.
2. The different ways fatalities occur, the levels of autonomy of a self driving car, and a video about why self driving cars aren't a thing yet.
3. The intent of the page isn't very clear without additional information. The message of each graphic was informative but I wasn't sure how they all tied together.
4. Policy makers, the media, and self-driving car companies.
5. Make sure each section of the web page represents the point you're trying to get across. I wasn't sure I saw a key point throughout.

*Interview 3*


## **Revised Wireframes**
The following are the revisions based on interviewee feedback:
