# **Final Project Part III**
This project explored enacted legislation in the United States regarding the implementation, testing, and/or exploration of autonomous vehicles (AVs), and any implications this legislation has on the future state of autonomous vehicles. The research found that no states completely outlaw the use of autonomous vehicles (at most they have zero legislation). Legislators seemed generally concerned with the impacts of legislation, but the level of interest vis legislation is highly varying. Without consistent legislation across the states, it is unlikely the height of the benefits of autonomous vehicles (lives saved via reduction in auto accidents, improvement in traffic flow,  increased mobility, etc.). Consistent legislation would ensure developers/manufacturers would have clear and consistent laws to abide by when deploying vehicles.

It is important to note this research is conducted under the knowledge that a fully autonomous, or level five, vehicle is not yet realized from a technology perspective. The intention of the research is to understand which states are "ready" for fully autonomous and what states are more restrictive, and what that may do to realizing the full benefits of AVs.

## **Intended Audience** 
The intended auidence for this project is state legislators and/or federal legislators. The more likely audience is state legislators seeing as many states already have legislation and it is less difficult to update legislation than it is to start from the beginning. Whereas passing federal legislation regarding autonomous vehicle legislation has been attempted but not successful. 

Keeping legislators in mind while creating the visualizations and telling the story limited my scope for a couple reasons. First, I wanted to keep the test and visualizations easy to digest and remember due to a legislator's likely busy schedule as well as for the potential that they did not have much knowledge about the topic or needed a refresher. Second, it kept the topic focused to high-level benefits that relate to legislators from any state. For example, every legislator is, assumedly, wanting to save lives which may be realized with the future implementation of AVs. If legislators had not been my key audience, I believe the visualizations may have been more technical in regard to the technological perspective (e.g., how exactly autonomous vehicles operate and how that is greater than most human drivers).

## **Project Process Summary** 
This process from start to end has been iterative and enlightening. I selected the topic due to my interest and found a relatively easy data set to use. More on the data can be found [here in Part I of the project](/FinalProject_PartI.md). I assumed after looking at the data set that map visualizations made sense, but I was uncertain how else to tell the story. After having some initial discussions with peers, some suggestions of visualizations arose that I did not think of, such as visualizing the impacts of auto accident deaths. This reflected how important it is to talk to others throughout the process, and not just a final review.

Regarding peers' suggestions of visualizing lethal auto accidents, I first attempted a representation through dots, each dot being worth 1,000 people. This was ultimately not effective as told by another round of interviews. I realized that making a visualization does not have to be all shapes and/or data, it can be simply strategic text. This is what I chose for the final form of this visualization. The pie chart I created to supplement this did not undergo many changes and viewers seemed to like it. 

Maps were one consistent visualization that remained throughout the project. However, the maps went through three different versions before the final version. It was interesting that something that I thought would be easy to create and immediately intuitive was not to different auidences who reviewed the visualizations. I was surprised by how much labels and colors meant to the audience and I needed to make those changes to my maps, and ultimately make them simpler. I carried the reinforced lesson of very clear labels and logical color choice into other data visualizations in the project. Initial iterations on the data, story, and critiques can be found [here in Part II of the project](/FinalProject_PartII.md). The final version of all of the visualizations (including new additions) can be found at the link below under "Final Project Deliverable."

After implementing changes, I felt that the story was missing visualizations and a gap in the narrative. I wanted to express how states have become increasingly more interesed in AVs in the past couple years, but also show the uncertainty that remains with their action. I created two charts in Tableau out of this piece of the story; the first a simple line chart that shows the number of pieces of most recent legislation passed by a state and then a bar graph that shows the number of pieces of legislation based on the different categories of legislation. Adding these pieces really felt like it tied the entire page together.

Overall, I was surprised at how many small changes each visualization needed in order to be as clear and cohesive as possible, and to effectively relay the message. For example, something like a title can completely change the way someone views a simple pie chart. I also learned complex visuzlizations are not better, and all of my visualizations are relatively simple but seem to fit better with the audience and high-level nature of the story I am telling. It was a great learning experience to go through and makes me think very critically of the visualizations I put together.
