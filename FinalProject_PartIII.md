# **Final Project Part III**
This project will explore enacted legislation in the United States regarding the implementation, testing, and/or exploration of autonomous vehicles, and any implications this legislation has on the future state of autonomous vehicles. Although many states have enacted legislation, even at a fully-autonomous level, all laws are with the understanding that the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Congress overrule the state's laws if they were to be made. Additionally, a fully autonomous, or level five, vehicle is not yet realized from a technology perspective. The intention of the research is to understand which states are "ready" for fully autonomous and what states are more restrictive.
