# **About Me**
Hello, everyone! My name is Taylor (she/her/hers) and I am a second year MSPPM student at CMU. I am originally from Minnesota and have not lived out of the state until I started this program. While in MN, I worked in local government in a few different roles. Seeing the importance of the public sector but also looking for a change and an update on my quantitative skills, I chose to come to CMU. I am most interested in transportation policy and have spent most of my time at CMU focusing on transportation-related projects when I can. My time at CMU has prepared me for my future career; I interned at a public sector consulting firm in New York City over the summer, and will be returing after graduation. 

# **What I Hope to Learn**
I hope to learn how to best communicate data-driven findings to a wide variety of audiences. I hope this ability to communicate will result in data-influenced decision-making. For example, I have overused bar and pie graphs both in school and professionally, but I did not know how to make them better. I hope to have more tools to address most data visualization need I will have. This skill is especially important in regard to my career after graduation.
