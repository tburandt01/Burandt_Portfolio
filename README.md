# **About Me**
# Hello, everyone! I am a second year MSPPM student at CMU. I am in the Telling Stories with Data course and will use this page as a means to post my work in the course.

# **What I Hope to Learn**
# I hope to learn how to best communicate data-driven findings to a wide variety of audiences. I hope this ability to communicate will result in data-influenced decision-making. 

# **Portfolio**
# This section will contain future data visualization work.
