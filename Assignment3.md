# **Assignment 3**
The following are visualizations created for Assignment 3 and 4 in Telling Stories with Data. 

## **Part 1: Selecting the Data Visualization** 
I selected a visualization from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website that details the number of speeding-related fatalities in 2016. This is the visualization in the bottom right of the dashboard. I selected this graphic for a few reasons. First, I am very interested in transportation policy and found it very exciting to explore how transportation data is currently being visualized as well as what data is available. Second, this set of data is presented in a dashboard that is somewhat overwhelming, and the opportunity to disect what is happening and recreate one visualization seemed exciting.

## **Part 2: Analyzing the Visualization** 
After slecting the graphic, I drew a wireframe and asked for feedback. Feedback mostly concerned color choices and being clearer about labels. I didn't realize how confusing the color choices would be even when a key was available. I also neglected to draw the pop-up boxes that I knew were available in Tableau (as I was planning to use for my tool), and after telling that to my reviewers they agreed that would be useful. Below is the sketch of the wireframe that was shown to others for their review.

## **Part 3: Reconstructing the Visualization** 
After viewing the bar chart, I knew more information needed to be added, especially in regard to benchmarking the data. Benchmarking in this case is showing how the number of speeding-related fatalities compares to the total number of fatalities on a specific type of roadway. While constructing, I was very aware of trying to adopt an appropriate color scheme and be explicit about labels without cluttering the graph. It was difficult to add all of the information I wanted without risking chart junk. One example of what I wanted to add was the percent of deaths caused by speeding-related fatalities, but some of that information did not make it onto the visualization without it being too much to see at once. I was able to add "pop-up" boxes over each bar that does provide more information about the data. I think the new visualization shows not only what the previous visualization showed, but it shows it shows the depth of the problem and if speeding is the main reason of automobile deaths. This is especially important if the key audience is policymakers and/or engineers and they want to quickly understand the current status of one cause of automobile deaths. I envisioned this being the intended audience as that is what I thought when I saw the original visualization. Below is the visualization I constructed on Tableau.
